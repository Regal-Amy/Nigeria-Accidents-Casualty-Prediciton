# Road Accident Data Analysis and Prediction in Nigeria

## Project Overview
This project analyzes road accident data in Nigeria. Using a comprehensive dataset covering over 2 years, I identified key factors contributing to accidents, such as speeding and mechanical defects. The project employs Random Forest Regressor to predict accident occurrences and severity, providing actionable insights for improving road safety.

## Data
The dataset used in this project includes records of road accidents in Nigeria over a two-year period, detailing various attributes such as accident location, cause, and severity. Key insights were drawn from data analysis to identify trends and patterns in accidents across different states.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted to understand the dataset and uncover patterns, including identifying the highest accident cases in Ogun State and FCT.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Key features affecting accident occurrences and severity were selected and transformed for model training.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Random Forest Regressor was used for predicting accident occurrences in each states.

## Results
The analysis revealed that Ogun State has the highest total reported accident cases (about 1750) in Nigeria, closely followed by FCT Abuja. Speeding and mechanical defects were identified as the leading causes of accidents in Ogun State. 

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, it is recommended to:
- Implement stricter regulations against speeding and improve vehicle maintenance checks.
- Increase public awareness campaigns focusing on road safety.
- Utilize predictive analytics to proactively address high-risk areas.

## Model
The project employs Random Forest Regressor for predicting road accidents, with a focus on accuracy and reliability in forecasting occurrences and severity. The predictive model demonstrated accuracy of 78.9% in forecasting accident occurrences.
